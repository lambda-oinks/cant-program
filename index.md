I'm not a programmer.

At least, I don't consider myself to be one. And yet I made this blogging platform. 

To be clear, I also don't consider myself to be a coder or developer or hacker; this isn't about the semantics. It runs deeper than that. I've used Python, Haskell and JavaScript for various programs, from fun Project Euler problems to basic software for astronomical research. But when someone asks me if I can program (as someone inevitably does, here in the Bay Area), I answer, "no." 

Friends have told me that I do know how to program, and that's different from being a good or experienced programmer. But I still feel uneasy about it. 

So, what's going on here?

1) Lack of self-confidence in programming

2) Discomfort in indentifying as a programmer




Representation of Self
=======================

At parties, I dread the inveitable conversation starter: "So, what do _you_ do?" 

Paralyzed, I stutter and mumble. "I, uh, well, I guess I like neural nets, I don't know."

Perhaps a well-intentioned rephrasing, in case I hadn't understood: "Where do you work?" 

"I don't."

"Oh, so you're a student?"

"No. Well, kinda. I mean I haven't been in school since 10th grade."

"Oh?" Now it's starting to get interesting. Or perhaps just more awkward.

Introductions

I should have my introduction down to a tee by this point. But every time
